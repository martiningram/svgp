# Scalable Variational Gaussian Process library (SVGP)

This library contains code to fit Gaussian processes (GPs) using variational
inference. The key reference is:

Hensman, James, Alexander Matthews, and Zoubin Ghahramani. "Scalable variational
Gaussian process classification." (2015).
Available here: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v38/hensman15.pdf

The code provides a simple implementation in Tensorflow 2. We also extend the
methodology to do approximate variational inference in hierarchical multi-output
Gaussian processes (MOGPs).

We are still working on documentation -- stay tuned!
